# PokéAPI Pokédex

## Background
This project was completed as part of the Purdue IEEE Software Saturdays workshop in Spring 2022. This was my first exposure to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the React library.

## Description
This project interfaces with the PokéAPI found <a href = https://pokeapi.co>here</a> to import names and sprites and provides a basic card interface to click through and view the name, number, and sprite of each of the original 151 Pokémon.

## How to Use
This project is a React app, so after cloning or downloading the project it can be ran with `npm install` followed by `npm start`. More details on getting started with React can be found <a href = https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.htmlhttps://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html>here</a>.
